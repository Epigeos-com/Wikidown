## Description
Download wikipedia pages by prefix using a simple console app.
This app only has one feature, download by prefix, no fancy stuff.
It doesn't support prefixes with unicode because console apps have a lot of trouble with that, feel free to add it if you'd like.
## Download
1. Download the package (green 'Code' button on top of the page then 'Download ZIP')
2. Unzip it
3. Open the 'builds' folder
4. Open the exe file
